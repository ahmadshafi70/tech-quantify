Hello,

At the moment the simplest & fastest way of starting receiving payments
is Perfect Money Payment button. All you need to do is create payment

Shopping Cart Interface.

To install Perfect Money SCI manually please follow the documentation:
https://perfectmoney.is/documents/perfectmoney-sci-2.0.doc

You can use SCI generator to generate payment form:

Alternate PassPhrase which you need for payment verification can be
found and set under Settings section in your PM account.

Sample PHP-scripts to verify payments can be found here:

To improve the security level of payment verification we suggest to add payment
checking via API interface. This means that when confirmation comes to
your STATUS_URL you need to make a request
to our API function historycsv.asp passing batch number of transaction.
In return you will get payment info (if payment with the batch_id
exists) or no payment info (if no payment with such batch was actually
done). You should check if payment info you got in confirmation
corresponds to payment info you got in this API request.

This document describes how to programmatically interact with the Perfect Money web
site (API): https://perfectmoney.is/documents/perfectmoney-api.doc
